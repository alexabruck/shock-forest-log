The Shock Forest Log is the visual archive of the [Shock Forest Group](https://hethem.nl/en/Chapter-Two/Door-Nicolas-Jaar-Shock-Forest-Group):

> From September 11, 2019 through December 21, 2019, a group of researchers, artists, and
> activists called the <L t="shockforestgroup" /> lived and worked at <L t="hethem" />,
> a cultural institution in Zaandam, Netherlands. Het HEM is located in the former 0,50 caliber
> <L t="bullets" /> factory on the ex-military <L t="hembrug" /> terrain. Although
> the building was built in 1956, the company that occupied it, Artillerie Inrichtingen,
> also known as <L t="ai" />, had been supplying weapons
> for Dutch <L t="colonialism" /> since 1679. In 1973, AI split, and the 0,50 factory
> became property of the new company <L t="eurometaal" />.
