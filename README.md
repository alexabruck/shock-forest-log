The Shock Forest Log is the visual archive of the [Shock Forest Group](https://hethem.nl/en/Chapter-Two/Door-Nicolas-Jaar-Shock-Forest-Group):

> From September 11, 2019 through December 21, 2019, a group of researchers, artists, and
> activists called the [#shockforestgroup](https://shockforest.group/#/?hashtags=shockforestgroup) lived and worked at [#hethem](https://shockforest.group/#/?hashtags=hethem),
> a cultural institution in Zaandam, Netherlands. Het HEM is located in the former 0,50 caliber
> [#bullets](https://shockforest.group/#/?hashtags=bullets) factory on the ex-military [#hembrug](https://shockforest.group/#/?hashtags=hembrug) terrain. Although
> the building was built in 1956, the company that occupied it, Artillerie Inrichtingen,
> also known as [#ai](https://shockforest.group/#/?hashtags=ai), had been supplying weapons
> for Dutch [#colonialism](https://shockforest.group/#/?hashtags=colonialism) since 1679. In 1973, AI split, and the 0,50 factory
> became property of the new company [#eurometaal](https://shockforest.group/#/?hashtags=eurometaal).
